The next day we got ready to set off on our adventure to see the iconic Cliffs of Moher. After a few hours of unclear directions and about a thousand roundabouts, we reached the cliffs. It was nearing sunset, and the winds were strong, but it turned out to be the most beautiful and perfect time to see them. We snapped some pics, marveled at the incredible view, and then we were on our way back to Galway. The drive offered some of the most beautiful countryside I have ever seen. It was what I had expected, but 100x better. That night we ate some dinner at a pub and then checked out a couple Christmas markets and some ‘Oktoberfest’-type tents where we met some of Raquel’s friends. All I can say about the Christmas markets in Europe is DAT MULLED WINE DOE.

The next morning we woke up and went for brunch with Raquel at the cutest little brunch place I ever did see, and then we set off for our drive back to Dublin. Unfortunately our rental car didn’t have an AUX input (?!?!), so we stopped at a local shop and picked up Adele’s new album. Needless to say we BLASTED it all the way back to Dublin. Now I can’t listen to ‘Hello’ and NOT be immediately transported back to cruising down the highway with Kell, singing (poorly), laughing, and loving every second of it.

So there you have it. This was my little taste of Ireland and I couldn’t have asked for better company to experience it with.

(PS – S/O to Kell for being such a champ and putting up with me on this trip, luv u long time)
