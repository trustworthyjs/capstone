Well well, another year come and gone. 2018??? Weren’t we supposed to have flying cars by now? Instead Trump is still president and we have people eating tide pods for video views… you can’t make these things up.

I hope everyone enjoyed their Christmas holidays; I definitely did! It was the perfect break after late nights working at the pub. My first few days back in Canada I stayed in Vancouver and visited with some of my faves. Adventures included eating delicious food, strolls to check out the Christmassy decorations all around the city, and great catch-ups.

We met up with some family friends, Mike and Cindy, and Courtney and Sean, and we had a perfect two weeks. Some of the highlights would definitely include:

Quality time with the fam
Going to the Sentry Tournament of Champions golf tournament with my Dad
Meeting Rickie Fowler and Jordan Speith at above golf tournament (!!!! golf nerd)
Early-morning runs to the beach to catch sunrise by the ocean
Concert at Fleetwood’s on Front Street
Moped-ing along the coast to the Nakalele Blowhole at the north of the island
Getting tanned af
I won’t bore you with going into detail about each highlight, but we made some fun memories and enjoyed each other’s company (for the most part…you know how family holidays can go…). Overall, an amazing trip.
