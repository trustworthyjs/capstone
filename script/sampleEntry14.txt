LISBON
I’ve actually been to Lisbon (or Lisboa) before, but only for about an hour. So I was excited to explore the city with Sam. We stayed at the Sunset Destination Hostel, which I would 10/10 recommend – a rooftop pool and bar, the best lamb burgers I’ve ever tasted, included breakfast, and located downtown right on the river. Lisbon is one of the most picturesque places I’ve ever travelled to – if you were to give a proper photographer a camera and send him into the streets, he would come out with some mind-blowing photos filled with pastel-coloured buildings, balconies, uphill and downhill streets (think San Francisco), and trams. We met some amazing people, went on various walking tours, got lost (standard), went on a pub crawl, took a day trip to Belem, ate pastries, and overall, enjoyed ourselves. Let the photos speak for themselves:
