BACK TO LONDON
And just like that, I was back in London with 3 days before I began my new life in Cranleigh. I spent the couple days relaxing/sleeping in (much needed) and exploring some more of the city. Here’s a funny/unfortunate story: I went to Buckingham Palace one day, and being alone, I had my headphones in just minding my own business, and apparently while I was literally in front of the Palace, but looking the opposite direction, Prince Harry drove out and stopped and waved to everyone. And I didn’t notice. GREAT. So close yet so far haha. Anyway, other than the Palace, I went to the Camden Market (so cool), chilled at Hyde Park, shopped along Oxford Street, and just did whatever I felt like which was nice. I also had some pretty cool roommates in my hostel room, and the night before I left, we all went to the hostel bar for a couple drinks (as you can see in the last London picture, one guy had one too many drinks). My favourite thing about traveling is 100% the people I meet. The next morning, I had a bank appointment and after that, I was off to my new home.

So, there you have it. 4 countries in 10 days. Sorry it’s been such a long post. Thanks for sticking around and reading!
