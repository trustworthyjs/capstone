BERLIN
This is where Sam and I parted ways after just over a week of travel together. It was a whirlwind. I left the hostel quite early, around 530AM to catch my flight to Berlin. I arrived in the afternoon and was greeted by my dear friend Kelly at the train station. We made our way back to her flat where her mom Lori was waiting (our trips overlapped). I quickly refreshed myself and we set off to find a good ol’ German wurst (a sausage, essentially) and then we spent the rest of the day being absolute tourists – a river boat cruise/tour, Checkpoint Charlie, the Berlin Wall, the Brandenburg Gate, the Jewish Memorial, etc. The next couple days Kelly had to work a bit, so I took advantage of the time I had to explore the city. It was so good to see Kelly again and my favourite part of the trip was being there when she found out she got the job she’s been wanting. #Proud. I went to Berlin with absolutely no knowledge of the city or it’s history (other than the Berlin Wall, of course) and left very impressed with its beautiful scenery, great food, creative/art scene, and it’s laid-back vibe. I will definitely be back. Prost!
