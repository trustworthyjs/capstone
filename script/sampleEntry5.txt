This myth is completely FALSE. Being a Canadian, and even more so, being a British Columbian, it’s hard to not consider myself a nature lover and living in a city so filled with tourists, locals, and just PEOPLE, well it’s taken a bit of a toll on my mental and emotional health (I mean not really, but you know). Back home I’m used to doing hikes outdoors (shout out to Mt. Doug!) most days of the week, so living here in a city with minimal nature and maximum people, I needed to find somewhere to clear my head. I googled ‘hiking in madrid’ and found another blog post about hiking trails just an hour train ride away in a small town called Cercedilla. K, so I kiiind of lied. The hiking isn’t IN Madrid, obviously, but a ridiculously short train ride away. It was the best feeling leaving the chaotic train station and having the scenery transitioning into beautiful countryside. The quaint and small town of Cercedilla and the beautiful hiking was exactly what you need after some time living in the hustle and bustle of the big city. Remember to set aside a whle day dedicated to the hike, as when my friend and I did it, we were gone for a good 7 hours in total! Here is the link to the blog post I read, which explains how to get there and some more in-depth details about the hiking: http://spanishsabores.com/2012/08/19/hiking-in-madrid-cercedilla/
