As I said work’s been great – the people, the food, the guests… except every single day at the pub I can guarantee I will get this question at least 3 times:

So, where in America are you from?

*eyeroll*

I get it. Our accents are very similar to Americans, especially coming from the West Coast. I usually proceed to tell them with a half-forced chuckle and smile “Haha, I get that a lot, but I’m actually Canadian”, and then they usually proceed to backtrack and apologize profusely for offending me. lol. I don’t take much offence from it, but it does get a little old. I’ve even had one American (Californian, to be exact) guest tell me I sound exactly like I’m from Los Angeles, California. To be fair, I don’t go around saying ‘aboot’ and discussing igloos and Tim Hortons, so I can see why it would be hard to tell the difference. Either way, it’s always a good conversation starter.

Well now that I’m nearing 3 weeks on the job and being in Cranleigh, I think it’s safe to say it’s a good fit. Especially when I get work perks like this:

Of course I have my moments of missing home, my friends, family, or even feeling a bit lonely, but that’s the beauty of technology – Mom is only a Facetime call away!

Thanks for taking the time to read all of this (or skim, at least). Hope you enjoyed! Next up: posts on my trips to Lisbon, Barcelona, Berlin, and Scotland.
