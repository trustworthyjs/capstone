After some extended family visiting, my parents picked me up and we made our way back to good old Merritt for Christmas.

It never ceases to amaze me how little things change in Merritt, but that’s also what I love about coming home. Driving into town and seeing everything still in it’s same place and seeing the same people walking around is always comforting. As much as I love being (far) away from home, I love coming back. During my very few days at home consisted of lots of family time with my parents, Auntie Terry, and Grandma, as well as family friends. We stuck to our Christmas Eve tradition and went to Christmas Eve mass at the church, met up with our family friends, and sang Christmas carols. Then, Mom and I had some wine. Ok, we had lots of wine. Would it really be Christmas without a little excessive drinking? Nah, probs not.

 Christmas was wonderful – it was a great day of good company and good food and you can’t ask for much more than that really. Grandma made her famous stuffing/dressing (what do you call it???) and I ate enough to last me until next Christmas.

This Boxing Day was meant to be the first Boxing Day in years that I didn’t go out and was literally in my PJs and about to run a bath when Braydon guilt-tripped me into going. I gave in and ended up at the Val that night, as I should have done. It was actually a great night and was nice to see so many old friends. Who needs a high school reunion when you have Boxing Day, amirite?

Soon, my parents and I were off to Vancouver to fly off to MAUI, HAWAIIIIII!! I couldn’t wait to get some sun and some sea. It had been way too long. My favourite part of getting there is walking off the plane and feeling the humid Hawaiian breeze. Nothing better.
