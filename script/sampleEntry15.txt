BARCELONA
*cue Ed Sheeran – Barcelona*

We were kind of sad to be leaving Lisbon because we loved it so much, but we were super excited for what Barcelona had in store. We arrived in the morning and checked into our hostel called the Rodamon which was in the Gracia neighbourhood. Barcelona was a fun, easy-going and busy city. So much history and culture, which we learned a lot about on another walking tour we took (seriously though, they’re the best way to see/learn things). Each day was jam packed with activities and plans that by the time most people our age were going out to the bars/clubs on the beaches, we were having some wine and going to sleep. Lol. My favourite part of Barcelona was the Sagrada Familia, which is a basilica designed by Gaudí. It’s one of those buildings that when you actually witness it in person, it is so grand and so beautiful that it almost brings you to tears. My eyes may have gotten a bit misty. Park Güell, a park showcasing many designs also by Gaudí was amazing and of course made me feel like I was a Cheetah Girl. We also got to tour around Montjuic, where the 1992 Olympics stadium is located. A fellow Merritonian, Vishal, was studying in Barcelona at the time so we met up with him and his friend Evan for dinner one night. It’s always nice connecting with familiar faces overseas.

Barcelona was interesting to me because, having lived in Madrid for 4 months, I expected it to feel quite similar. However, because they speak Catalan (Barcelona is in Spain’s Catalonia region), the language wasn’t solely Spanish and the overall vibe was much different. Don’t get me wrong, I loved Barcelona, it was just much different than I expected. Here are some of my fave pics:
